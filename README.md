# New York City For-Hire Vehicles Trip Data

**Overview**

New York City is well known for the transportation services offered across the 5 boroughs. Including, but not limited to, bikes, taxis, trains, and ferrys. These services allow riders to have a variety of services to travel from one location to another and drivers to have a source of income.

This project will focus on the For-Hire Vehicles (FHVs) in New York City. FHVs are ride-share companies like Uber and Lyft that match drivers with riders, and vice-versa. These companies have their own apps that make this process fast and easy.

The TLC provides publicly accessible trip data on there [website](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page).

**Goals**

1. Develop a dashboard for drivers and riders to use on their next trip
2. Understand the trip behavior of New Yorkers and find reoccuring patterns
3. Determine how Uber and Lyft makes their profits
